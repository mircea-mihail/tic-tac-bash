# TIC-TAC-BASH #
 
 This is a small project for my Operating Systems course meant to recreate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the Bash terminal using ncurses.

 ## Instalation ##

In order to install this project on your computer what you have to to is run ``` make install ``` which will put this game's executable on your OS' $PATH

## How to play ##

The first player is X. In order to pick a place in the table they have to click on it with the mouse. Run the game with the -k argument as shown below to play using the keyboard.

``` tic-tac-bash -k ```

This maps the game's tabe as shown below:

q | w | e
---------
a | s | d  
---------
z | x | c
