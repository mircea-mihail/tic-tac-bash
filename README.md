# TIC-TAC-BASH #
 
 This is a small project for my Operating Systems course meant to recreate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the Bash terminal using ncurses.

 ## Instalation ##

In order to install this project on your computer what you have to to is run:
``` make install ``` 
which will put this game's executable on your OS' $PATH (/usr/local/bin)

You can move the executable anywhere on the path yourself if /usr/local/bin does not work for you. You can also run this project directly from this directory with 
``` ./tic-tac-bash ```

## How to play ##

The first player is X. In order to pick a spot in the table they have to click on the desired spot with the mouse. There is also the option to play using the keyboard. Below is shown how the keys are mapped on the game's table:

```
q | w | e
---------
a | s | d  
---------
z | x | c
```
